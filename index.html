        <h3>IDTech iOS Framework Overview</h3>

        <p>The IDTech iOS Framework gives your iOS App the ability to interact with an IDTech VP3300 Bluetooth credit card reader. The framework
        handles the credit card data coming from the reader on your behalf by sending it to our servers and returning a secured JWT (json web token)
        which you can present later to our mobile gateway endpoint for payment processing.
        </p>

        <h3>How it works</h3>

        <p>Clearent has 'wrapped' the IDTech framework so we can handle the sensitive card data as well
        as provide a few extra methods for easier integration. The framework does not run the payment. It only secures the card data.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Recommended Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>The framework provides many capabilities and because of these does support different flows. We have found the best implementation to be:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Identify the reader first. With all new technologies the challenge is to get the User up to speed on its use. Even though the framework supports searching for the bluetooth reader and running the transaction in the same flow, we recommend separating out the two concerns so the experience at the time of running a transaction , while the customer is present, is optimized. In your app, provide a separate settings section allowing the User to set up the reader. Let them initiate a bluetooth search and select from one or more found readers. Then save the bluetooth info they selected.
            </li>
            <li>Display the status of the reader connection.
            </li>
            <li>Provide the User with an interface to start the transaction.
            </li>
            <li>Provide the User with an interface to cancel the transaction.
            </li>
            <li>Display messages to the User coming back from the framework (feedback callback).
            </li>
            <li>From your settings area provide the ability to force a bluetooth disconnect.
            </li>

        </ol>
        
        <h3>Bluetooth Search Flow</h3>
        <p>Follow this from your settings to identify the reader</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start a bluetooth search.
            </li>
            <li>Monitor for bluetooth devices sent back from framework.
            </li>
            <li>Communicate with User the device was found or if more than one found present a list for the User to choose from.
            </li>
            <li>Record the selected reader for future use.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Transaction Flow</h3>
        <p>With a reader identified the transaction flow is simplified.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start a transaction with a previously identified reader using the startTransaction method that allows you to provide the payment request and the connection information.
            </li>
            <li>Monitor for feedback from framework and display to User.
            </li>
            <li>Monitor for transaction token (JWT) from framework.
            </li>
            <li>Present transaction token to Clearent Mobile Gateway when ready to run a payment.
            </li>
        </ol>
