        <h3>Overview</h3>


        <p>The framework will send back messages related to bluetooth connectivity and when the User is interacting with the reader during a transaction. Some of these can be monitored and handled without the User's knowledge. The minimum feedback all Users should see are the User Actions since the framework can give feedback related to how they are interacting with the reader. An example would be if the User swiped a chip card or inserted a chip card wrong. Some of the informational messages are still helpful so if the design can represent those as well it is recommended.
        </p>


        <p>This enum defines the types of feedback.</p>
        <pre><code>
            typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, CLEARENT_FEEDBACK_MESSAGE_TYPE) {
